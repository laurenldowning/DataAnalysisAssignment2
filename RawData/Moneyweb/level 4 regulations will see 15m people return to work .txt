 


NOMPU SIZIBA: On Saturday the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, and Trade and Industry Minister Ebrahim Patel outlined proposals for the Covid-19 Level 4 regulations, which are set to take effect on May 1. Controversially, they asked for public submissions to be made by noon on the Freedom Day holiday yesterday, April 27, in order to incorporate public comment for the finalised regulations set to be published by Thursday. The proposal will see a number of industries being able to go back on strict conditions around the ability to social distance and screen their workers and customers, and so on. The ministers said that some 1.5 million people would be able to return to work.
To discuss the latest proposed regulations, I’m joined on the line by Professor Raymond Parsons of the Economic and Management Sciences Division at the North West University Business School. Thanks very much, professor, for joining us.
The ministers came out on Saturday to give us a feeling of the number of sectors that are going to be able to perform – and some of the businesses that are going to be able to perform under the sectors. We’ve got the likes of wholesale and retail coming out in the food, hygienic, cleaning, protective and baby-care areas, as well as stationery and winter clothing.
And then, under manufacturing, 50% of workers related to the manufacturing of stationery, cement and construction, can come in and work. Under transportation and logistics, cargo for domestic and neighbouring transport, with the prioritisation given to Level 4 goods, and so on.
The media obviously has been playing its role as an essential service, in any event, so they can come on board and work as well, as can services like vehicle recovery, emergency car repairs, emergency repair work, plumbers, electricians and so on. Basically the minister in the Department of Trade and Industry says that about 1.5 million people will be returning to work.
So the question really is: did the government get it right, or could they have afforded to have included a few more industries or sectors?
RAYMOND PARSONS: I think we should start by saying we mustn’t lose sight of the big picture, which was sketched very well by our President yesterday in his weekly letter, where he emphasised the shattering impact which the lockdown and Covid-19 have had on our economy. And hence we are now looking at a way in which we can phase it out.
This economic recovery that we are hoping to get really depends on three factors. The one is whether there is going to be a revival in in the world economy, as we’re quite dependent on that. Second is the effective implementation of the economic-relief measures which we’ve announced. That’s quite important. And then, finally, what you’ve outlined – the pace at which our lockdown is going to be phased out.
So the big test is going to be this week, in the light of the proposals which have been made, and which you’ve outlined. We should bear in mind, however, that we want to lead in this process to get rid of any regulations which are unworkable, or which are counter-productive. And that is the purpose of the consultation.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Yes.
RAYMOND PARSONS: The proposals made at the end of last week were to  include how the government thinks it should move to Level 4. I think the inputs which I hope have been made in the last day or so will urge where it could be more flexible, or where it could go further.
I think the important point, which the minister also emphasised, is simply that we want to get more South Africans back to work. It mustn’t just be a PR exercise. People must be got back to work under fair conditions, and we need to come at the end of this week with a sensible set of proposals which will take us into Level 4.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Yes. Government’s method of reintroducing people to the sector is on a “risk-adjusted basis” – that’s what they call it. Would it have been more sensible to work on a company-type basis rather than sectors, because within sectors you may have businesses that don’t necessarily lend themselves to all the important things that we must do, like social distancing.
RAYMOND PARSONS:  Well, I think the consensus of opinion, Nompu, is that this risk-adjusted approach has a lot of merit. It’s something you can debate and you can adjust it. I see that Neva Makgetla in Business Day today thinks, however, that the effect of risk-management is not here yet; we’re not yet seeing it. Although that’s meant to be the framework, we aren’t seeing it yet. And that’s why I think these consultations and these inputs of this group are really quite important to see whether we can make this risk-adjustment process and this framework work effectively by the time we get to the decisions at the end of the week, and then go from there.
The important point is we must be common-sensical about what is either unworkable, or which is counter-productive with this engagement. And I see that the World Health Organization has praised us for this whole consultation element – that it must be effective. It must be seen to make a difference. In other words, whatever is decided by the end of this week must look a little different to what was said on Saturday.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Yes, of course one of the gripes that people did have was that the presentation was made on a Saturday afternoon, and people had, what, only 48 hours to respond because they would have had to submit their submissions by noon on Freedom Day, yesterday, the holiday. This means that somebody who wants to really seriously give feedback was not given that much time.
RAYMOND PARSONS: Well, I think it’s simply because of the deadline of the end of the month that the government obviously does not want to extend without moving to another level. And I also would say that, nonetheless, as inconvenient this is, there’s been such a robust debate about how to do it better, that I shouldn’t think that many of those interested parties who want to make inputs, are simply ready, I think – and we are into uncharted waters here – with whatever research and inputs they want to make, so that whatever decisions we take by the end of this week will be the best ones in the circumstances.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Yes.
RAYMOND PARSONS: So I think it’s unfortunate that these timelines are so compressed, but these are the uncharted waters in which we’re operating at the moment.
NOMPU SIZIBA: You talked about using common sense. I saw something on Twitter – a hairdresser saying, if it’s okay for a taxi to be full of people or at 70% capacity, surely it’s okay for me to have four people in my salon doing people’s hair, because – let’s think about it – that particular sector is going to be absolutely hammered. Everyone who’s not able to go to work is going to be hammered. But common sense says they should be able to adhere to social distancing and all of that if they have [only] a few people in their in their salons.
RAYMOND PARSONS: I think it’s important that, subject to those safeguards, if you want to retain people’s confidence, if you want to retain people’s cooperation, then you must have a common-sense approach. You’ve don’t say, look, there are practical realities. We now need to adjust them because clearly a healthy society and a healthy economy are interdependent for South Africa.
And so we want whatever adjustments are made to the rules to appeal to people, and say we are moving in a phased way, we are  weighing up the risks, we’re taking on board the practical considerations that retain people’s confidence; that it is a consistent risk-adjusted process that retains the cooperation of people because, at the end of the day, it’s got to be as much a bottom-up issue as it is a top-down one.
NOMPU SIZIBA: As we head to Level 4 on May 1, it does seem like the health statistics that we’re seeing are actually jumping more and more on a daily basis. Clearly it’s going to be very important for screening and testing to be ramped up at the workplace.
RAYMOND PARSONS: Absolutely. I think that’s got to be the framework within which you can build confidence, not only on the part of government – not only that they are able to make a success of the phased approach, but also so that each one of us must feel that, as we move towards one phase and the next phase, the environment within which we want to apply the public-health safety measures will still take place, and that there will be cooperation from everyone to say “we want this to succeed, we will work within the framework provided”. It’s a common-sensical and flexible one, which gets as many people back to work as possible, with the necessary safeguards at the workplace which we require.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Our thanks to Professor Raymond Parsons.
