 

In recent weeks, the South African government and various private sector players have implemented interim measures to curb the immediate and longer-term effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on business and industry.
At this moment, funding relief measures are not available for all sectors. However, to make the process easier for small business during this unprecedented time, we have compiled a ‘funding directory’ to assist in making your search simpler.
Please note the Sukuma Relief Programme – launched with an R1 billion donation from Johann Rupert – has now been closed to new applicants.
The UIF applications are open, however, there has been a delay in payments due to a number of applications coming through and the majority of those being processed are found to have incomplete application documents.
As the ministers from each department update on how the new funding relief measures announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday evening will work, the funding details below will be updated.
