 


NOMPU SIZIBA: The Property Industry Group, which comprises the South African Rates Association, the South African Property Owners Association and the South African Council of Shopping Centres, has announced an industry-wide assistance and relief package for retail tenants hard-hit by the Covid-19-related 21-day lockdown. The primary focus is especially on weaker SMMEs across all sectors, but there is a willingness to negotiate concessions with larger, financially stronger, retailers. And the Property Industry Group says the relief benefits will only be made available to those retailers who undertake not to retrench staff during the relief period.
Well, to tell us more about the measures, I’m joined on the line by Estienne de Klerk, the spokesperson for the Property Industry Group, as well as the chairman of the South African Reit Association.
Thanks very much, Mr de Klerk, for joining us. This looks like a very well-thought-through set of support measures, which include partial and full rental waivers over April and May, as well as interest-free rent deferrals. Just give us some specifics.
ESTIENNE DE KLERK: Nompu, I think the first thing is to understand that this is obviously a limited amount of real estate owners that have come together under the Shopping Centre Council with the South African Property Owners Association, and the South African Reit Association, which is mainly all the listed Reits. This might not include one or two of the landlords that haven’t been party to the whole process, but should cover the bulk of the landlords.
The main focus was that we are in this together, it is not something that really the law foresaw, so the legal position is really quite unclear. We have seen various positions being taken by various retailers. And I think from the real estate point of view, we understand that if you are not trading, clearly it’s going to have a big financial impact on our client, the retailer.

So what we have done is we’re trying to protect our small landlords, and also trying to protect our own businesses. But we are also trying to help specifically the small retailers in our shopping centres. What we have done is we’ve categorised the package between – let’s first start with essential services, and non-essential services. Essential are the guys who continue to trade, all the pharmaceuticals, the food retailers, and so forth. So those people do not need assistance and we haven’t offered them assistance at all.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Right.
ESTIENNE DE KLERK: There are sort of the hybrid scenarios, where they have parts of their trading floor which are now closed off, which might have clothes on, and the other part has food. So that partial scenario we are catering for.
Then what we’ve done is with all the non-essential services, we’ve split them between the small retailers below R80 million, and then the big retailers.
And the big ones we also are helping. We are basically saying they only have to pay us half the rent in April. And we’ve gone further; we are also dealing with May, saying May is going to be a tough month for everybody, so in May they also have to pay us half the rent. That 50% that they are not paying us we’ve split into a component which we discount entirely, and a component which we defer.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Yes.
ESTIENNE DE KLERK: So each month that differs slightly, but ultimately from a liquidity point of view we are offering, as a real estate industry to our clients, an injection or a help in liquidity, effectively – that they don’t have to pay half their rent for that period. Some of it will be deferred, which we’ll pick up later over the period, and some of it is written off entirely.
Then there are the small retailers, the guys that are really in a difficult position – those might be little restaurants, your hairdresser, which are the highly impacted ones, the ones that might not have any trade, and they are never going to recover it.
And then the medium-impacted guys are maybe people that can recover if they got products on the shelves, and so forth.
So there the packages vary a little bit. But, for the highly impacted, some guys depending on their financial strength and their the position, where the landlords might write off the April rent entirely, and then in May there’ll be a combination of write-off and deferral.
So what you can see is the industry really has shown quite a bit of goodwill here.
I think it’s the first industry in the country to actually say, look we’re prepared to actually take a proper haircut in what we’re going to receive. It’s not something by our design. Clearly nobody wants to make less money, but we understand that the retailers are also suffering in this process – that’s not by their design. So what we are trying to do is find some kind of equitable way to share the pain.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Yes.
ESTIENNE DE KLERK: And it’s not easy. Our country isn’t financially strong enough that we can get a stimulus package of $2 trillion or something, like the Americans have really dished out into the economy. From government’s point of view we do not have that benefit, so we as business in the South African economy, it’s all interlinked.
We’re going to have to work together, and really work through this thing.
Hopefully it is limited to the 21 days and after that things will open up, and over time business will come back to normality.
NOMPU SIZIBA: You talk about it not being by design – obviously it’s not by design, but at the same time if you were to fold your hands and your retail tenants were to fold their hands, then it’s going to be a lose-lose for everybody.
ESTIENNE DE KLERK: Correct. And I don’t think too many people understand the role of the real estate industry in the economy. We provide essential services out in the most remote areas of our country. In our communities it’s the town square. On a daily basis people collect services and goods from these shopping centres, and we’ve been amazed at the level of goodwill coming out of industry.
To give you an idea, the Health Department made a request to the Property Group for space for stations for testing, and we said we’d try to find out if there is a number. The last number I saw there were over 330 sites offered to government for free, to be able to provide these sites for testing, and so on. Some have even offered up properties for temporary hospitals and so on. So there really is a level of goodwill.
I think the other thing that one has to understand is that our businesses have very sticky expenses.  If we don’t pay our rates and taxes as real estate companies, municipalities will overnight be bankrupt, and will not be able to provide services to every man in the street who has a home.
I think the second thing that you have to understand is, we are very interlinked with the financial services sector. If we don’t pay the interest on our debt, the next thing there’s a big problem with the banking sector.
So it’s important that all these interconnected parts works together, basically trying to [ensure] that everything keeps going, and that we specifically focus on our smaller landlords and our smaller tenants to ensure that they survive, because collectively we are quite dependent on them. And hopefully after two months we’ll be through this thing.
NOMPU SIZIBA: You do make the point – in your piece that I saw – that you’re only going to be giving out these benefits or this relief programme to those tenants that don’t retrench people during the relief period, because you’re trying to save jobs.
ESTIENNE DE KLERK: We, as an industry, are a big employer. Directly we probably employ a couple of thousand people. But indirectly, if you think about the service industries that just serves the real estate sector – security, cleaning – these people employ thousands of people. We have undertaken as a sector to try and continue to pay all our bills to the extent that that is in any way a possible. And then, on the other hand, we are expecting our clients to undertake, if they’re going to get the benefit of some of this relief, to at least pay their own staff and continue to employ them for the two-month period.
So what we’re trying to do is protect the economy, or at least make our little contribution as an industry to the economy, and then help see that the benefits that we are passing through absolutely benefit all the people involved in the sector.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Of course, we’re crossing fingers and hoping that indeed the economy is allowed to open fully on April 17. We’ve seen across the world a number of countries – even here on the continent – an extension of lockdowns. Now, if it does happen that we open as usual on April 17, how geared up are your members in terms of the whole sanitation thing, because you guys have thousands and thousands of square metres that you must cover and ensure are sanitised and clean because, even though the lockdown will be over, obviously social distancing and cleanliness will still be top of mind.
ESTIENNE DE KLERK: In fact, most of our members, even before the lockdown was announced, had already employed quite stringent measures in terms of improved hygiene in our centres and cleaning through this lockdown period we’ve had to manage quite restrictive, let’s say, processes to ensure that limited people go into the centre, managing the flow of people. I think probably most of you have seen on TV some of the queues at some of these shopping centres in the first couple of weeks.
So we’ve have to work through some of these processes, and I would hazard a guess that we are probably reasonably well positioned at this point so that, once everything opens up, we’ll be able to manage that reasonably well. That is what we would be proposing as the industry. We believe that [with] the economic impact potentially – certainly if you understand the structure of our economy – it’s absolutely essential in certain communities that those people can come back to work. Some of them only work on a day-to-day basis, and they also shop on a day-to-day basis. And from that point of view we are really concerned about those communities in this whole process.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Looking at news items of late around retail tenants seemingly unilaterally deciding that they won’t pay rent, one gets the feeling that this may be a breeding ground for litigation. How are your members handling these public announcements, and are you confident that a meeting of minds can be reached behind closed doors?
ESTIENNE DE KLERK: The legal fraternity that sits behind this, offering different parties different advice, and clearly a good sight is not to be wasted.
I think from our point of view it’s really not in the interest of either our members or the retail fraternity to be engaged in a very long litigation situation. What we are trying to do is we’re trying to avoid it by what we believe is quite a generous package.
Now clearly there’s always going to be somebody whose expectations you can’t meet, but hopefully a good deal is where everybody is equally unhappy type of thing. Anyway, we are going to see how that progresses. We certainly are talking to government, because when government made these Covid-19 sort of announcements, I don’t think they ever envisaged that rental all of a sudden overnight now wasn’t payable, and all these kind of knock-on effects.
Across the world there are certainly benchmarks that we can refer to, like in Germany, where the government went on a name-and-shame kind of process. For example, Adidas was specifically highlighted as a tenant that didn’t pay, and it was encouraged to do so. They are paying the rent now. But we don’t want to go into that process. We are partners with our clients and, from our point of view, I’m sure we can find each other if we apply our minds and if everybody goes into the process with a level of goodwill.
What is difficult for both of us is the uncertainty in terms of the period, and certainly we are encouraging government – to the best of their ability, having to balance all these things – to take this into account.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Indeed. Many thanks for your time this evening, Estienne.
