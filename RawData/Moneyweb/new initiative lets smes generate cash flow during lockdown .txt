 


NOMPU SIZIBA: A number of initiatives have been spearheaded to assist SMEs during this difficult time in which they are closed, not getting any income and uncertain whether they’ll stay afloat post the lockdown – along with their staff. A group of young entrepreneurs have come together to create a vehicle that hopes to keep SMEs liquid during this time, so that they can cover their basic costs and manage to come through on the other side of the lockdown in a position to survive.
Well, to tell us more about the initiative, I’m joined on the line by the founder of Say Siyabonga – that’s our regular market commentator, Petri Redelinghuys. Thanks very much, Petri, for joining us. This idea is to help SMEs works through a voucher system. You describe it as a way to pay forward. Tell us more about it.
PETRI REDELINGHUYS: Good evening, and thank you for having me. Yes, the idea is really for SMEs to basically be able to list a voucher on a platform, where they can offer, for example, a discount to their customers for future delivery.
I come from a bit of a financial background. It’s almost like a bond issue, if you can call it that, where however, we obviously can’t market bonds that easily. So the voucher is a way to work around that. The idea is, for example, let’s say you’re a hairdresser, you could then sell a R300 voucher that is redeemable for R500 once the lockdown and social-distancing period is over.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Excellent.
PETRI REDELINGHUYS: That gives you as the SMME the ability to generate cash flow now, and also a way for you to get customers to come back into your store once the lockdown is over. We want to achieve two things: we want to generate cash flow for them now, so they can pay staff – most importantly – and other fixed expenses that they might have. And then obviously have a reason for the customer to come back after the social-distancing period is over.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Is this idea something you are replicating from somewhere else? Who conceived this solution?
PETRI REDELINGHUYS: I’m quite active on Twitter. I saw someone talking on Twitter about “Why I love New York. The pizza seller who sits still on my block is selling $75 bonds, which you can redeem for $100 worth of pizza when all this is over.” And at that point [I thought] this was a great idea. You can actually implement this on a platform basis, and open this up to more than just one store. And you’re back to work.
NOMPU SIZIBA: So what kind of businesses have you on-boarded to the platform? And, for those businesses that are interested in listening, and want to be included, what’s the process?
PETRI REDELINGHUYS: I’ll start off with the types of businesses that have already listed. We’ve got everything from a biltong shop to a boutique hotel to beauty salons, hair salons – everything, really. Restaurants are even listing vouchers. So there’s no real limitation that we’re putting on [it]. There’s an interesting as well – they do virtual reality sort of team-building stuff. So virtual reality, bomb-diffuser –  seems pretty fun. So any business, really, there’s no real limitation on exactly which one sector to focus on. There’s I think a lot of support within the restaurant sort of realm. There are a couple of those different sort of initiative start-ups.
We didn’t want to limit it to exactly just one sector of the economy. We think that every business has unique needs, and every business in different sectors of the economy may need some support. And if they have loyal customers that they can gather support from, this is a mechanism for them to be able to do so.
The idea is really to gain easy access that’s really quick and easy to get up online, depending on the influx of people that we get. We are completely run by volunteers at this stage. It takes a couple of hours to get the vouchers up, and then people can start buying them.
The registration process is relatively easy, so go to SaySiabonga.co.za. There’s a page to register your business. It’s basically four steps that you follow. You create your profile first. Then you’ll get an email from us with several instructions. We’ll need some supporting documents. Obviously we have to vet the businesses to make sure that the businesses that we do this for, or put vouchers up for, are actual legitimate businesses.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Yes.
PETRI REDELINGHUYS: We don’t have it just for businesses. You can be a freelancer as well, or a sole proprietor. So there is a [tab that says] upload your company documents. If you don’t have company documents, that’s all right, because there are other documents that we’ll ask you to provide, banking and that kind of stuff, just to vet and make sure that the businesses are legitimate.
Once that’s done we’d sort of go through that process of vetting, approve the vendor, and then they can log in and update and create a voucher. We then check that and make sure everything setup correctly, and then we publish it to the store.
So from there we have a wonderful team of freelancers who’ve basically all volunteered for this. We then do sort of social media sharing stuff – Hey, welcome to the new vendor. This is the person. From there, the small business, the vendor in this case, is able to take them into their little storefront that would be created for them, and then they can market that out to their client base.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Right. So the customer can go to the very same website, buy the voucher there. How long are the vouchers valid for?
PETRI REDELINGHUYS: We have to comply with the Consumer Protection Act. So the vouchers are valid for three years. Thank you to the lawyer who supported us in creating the terms and conditions document. So the vouchers are valid for three years and redeemable for three years after date of purchase.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Excellent. Petri, a fantastic idea, and I hope that you get a lot of traction on it. Thanks very much for giving us a flavour of what it’s all about.
