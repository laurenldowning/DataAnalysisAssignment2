During his latest address to the nation on Wednesday night, President Cyril Ramaphosa said that more than nine million people had also been screened as part of the country’s health response to the pandemic.
In addition to a significant increase in testing and screening capacity, he said that government has been able to acquire 25 000 more beds for quarantine, as well as more personal protective equipment and medical equipment.
Ramaphosa noted that this represents the “largest and most extensive public health mobilisation in the history of our country”.
“By delaying the spread of the disease, we have been able to strengthen the capacity of our health system and to put in place wide-ranging public health programmes to better manage the inevitable increase in infections,” he said.
