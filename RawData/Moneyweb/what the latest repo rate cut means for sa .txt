 


NOMPU SIZIBA: The Reserve Bank convened an emergency meeting today [Wednesday, April 14]. In the process they cut the repo rate, the rate at which the bank lends money to commercial banks, by 100 basis points, or one percentage point, to 4.25%. This takes the prime lending rate, the base rate commercial banks charge to their customers, to 7.75%. This emergency rate cut follows last month’s decision to cut rates by the same quantum. Just last month the central bank cited the prolonged lockdown due to Covid-19, and the slower recovery that this would create as downside risk to both economy and even inflation.
Well, to discuss the decision further, I’m joined on the line by Sanisha Packirisamy. She’s an economist at Momentum Investments. Thanks very much for joining us, Sanisha. Earlier in the day I spoke to an economic observer who said he wasn’t surprised by the latest move, arguing that it may actually be too little too late. What’s your assessment?
SANISHA PACKIRISAMY: Good evening, Nompu, and good evening to all of your listeners. In the sense of not really agreeing with that sentiment, I do believe that the South African Reserve Bank has acted quite aggressively and at quite an early stage. There was a really nice chart of data in the Monetary Policy Review that compared the South African example to many other emerging markets, and we do stand out as one of the emerging markets that has cut the most since the back end of January…
NOMPU SIZIBA: Wow!
SANISHA PACKIRISAMY: … when we started to see the Monetary Policy responses coming through to counter the negative impact of Covid-19.
NOMPU SIZIBA: The bank cites the lockdown as a primary driver for its decision, and obviously the impact that it is going to have on the economy. How difficult at this stage is it to quantify the economic damage that’s most certainly going to be unleashed on the economy?
SANISHA PACKIRISAMY: I think it’s extremely difficult at this stage, because a lot of it is really contingent on how long the lockdown actually persists. You can see that in terms of even the Sarb suggesting that they convened this meeting just to assess the economic damage from the extended lockdown, relative to their economic forecast when the first lockdown was announced.
In the questions-and-answers session that they held after the announcement, they also suggested that it was very difficult to look at the longer-term economic ramifications on things like job losses. So at this stage it’s very difficult to pinpoint numbers, given that we are uncertain as to how long the lockdown will persist, and uncertain around the trajectory of the Covid-19 infection rates going forward.
NOMPU SIZIBA: One of the reasons that’s often put forward in the Reserve Bank keeping the interest-rate differential wide, between South Africa’s rates and particularly the developed markets, is so that foreign investors remain attracted to the higher yields that our country’s bonds offer. Presumably that’s really not going to be an issue still, given that developed world markets’ interest rates are at zero.
SANISHA PACKIRISAMY: This is the thing that’s playing out right now. South Africa is not alone in cutting interest rates. We’ve seen developed markets aggressively cutting interest rates from an already weak base, and we’ve seen a number of emerging market countries also cutting rates. In other words, the Reserve Bank has spoken about their need to keep real interest rates in positive territory, but we’ve often found in past cycles, when we do enter a period of economic damage and recessionary-type conditions, that many central banks do actually often drift into negative real interest rates in the short term, but still have the medium-term aim of getting real interest rates back into positive territory.
And it’s even more important for South Africa to do that in the medium term, because our twin deficits, the current account deficit as well as the fiscal deficit, are deeply negative and more so than we find in the rest of the emerging world.
NOMPU SIZIBA: When it comes to the issue of inflation itself, what was the Reserve Bank saying about that? And, interestingly, I see that they’re pegging the average Brent crude oil price at around $42/barrel. Right now it’s currently standing around $30/barrel.
SANISHA PACKIRISAMY: Well, Nompu, in terms of the international oil price forecast, it didn’t really change that much from three-and-a-bit weeks ago, when we had the March MPC meeting. But in terms of the headline inflation numbers, these came off just slightly. So the biggest revisions were largely to growth.
In terms of the headline inflation forecast, they were previously anticipating inflation of 3.8% for this year on average. We are now expecting 3.6% and they are expecting that to decline to 4.5% for next year.
Our own forecasts at Momentum Investments are actually a bit lower than this. We see inflation below 3% on average for this year, and lower at 3.5%for next year. This is really on the back of a very slow pass-through from a depreciated currency into the consumer basket. We believe that in such a weak growth environment it’s going to be very difficult for retailers to pass on higher cost increases at a time when … is very low.
NOMPU SIZIBA: National Treasury was also out with a statement today, following a telephonic press conference with members of the media. They outlined the problems, anticipating serious economic contraction this year, and anticipating that the health sector will become extremely stretched as the economy opens up, and so on. But what did you get from them in terms of the interventions that National Treasury is in a position to make?
SANISHA PACKIRISAMY: Well, unfortunately in South Africa’s case, we already had a very large budget deficit, going into the Covid-19 crisis. So the magnitude of the fiscal stimulus response to this virus is going to be quite constrained. Whereas, when we looked at some of the other countries around the world, including some of the developed markets, we found that some of the fiscal stimulus responses have even exceeded what we saw during the global financial crisis.
Unfortunately South Africa does not have that luxury, so the measures that have been outlined are likely to have quite a limited impact on the economy – at least in 2020, when the fallout on economic growth is going to be at its largest.
They have spoken about re-prioritising spend, instead of increasing spend, so that means that we are taking spend ways from other sectors, and in the past couple of years we’ve seen government scaling back quite significantly on their goods and services budget. So we are starting to enter that environment where taking away from pre-existent budgets may mean weaker service-delivery responses to the poorer households of South Africa. So we are in quite a tight space on the fiscal front.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Why do you think they are pussy-footing around getting assistance from either the World Bank or the IMF? These institutions have made available funds that speak specifically to the coronavirus situation right across the world.
SANISHA PACKIRISAMY: Well, in a number of countries, even in Eastern Europe, there seems to be a bit of a stigma attached to getting assistance from the International Monetary Fund. This is really based on prior experiences with conditional funding. However, in this case, there has been a number of emergency funding that has been granted by the IMF to a number of economies, and we could still tap into that – which means it’s unconditional funding.
So I think it really is about that negative stigma attached to the conditionality of funding from the likes of the IMF, but in this case we could actually tap on emergency funding, which doesn’t come with that conditionality.
NOMPU SIZIBA: But of course you say what you say, but there does seem to be a little bit of confusion within the alliance, because I think some alliance members feel that, talking of the stigma that you’re talking about, we might be going for these structural-adjustment type of programmes. And yet the finance minister is saying whatever we go for, it wouldn’t be going down that route. Surely it’s now that we need to be tapping on those kinds of funds so that, when we do open up the economy, some of the things that need to be in play, like your ventilators, more beds for people when they get sick – because this thing is not going away – we have all those things in play. In the meantime, we’re not hearing anything.
SANISHA PACKIRISAMY: Exactly, Nompu. I think this really speaks to the fractious nature of the political situation in South Africa. In the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis we saw all political parties coming together and speaking with one voice. But the cracks of are starting to emerge when you look at issues such as IMF funding and the availability of such funding. This is unfortunately something that really could damage South Africa’s ability to embark on structural reform, if it’s to push growth to higher levels in the medium term.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Sanisha, always a pleasure talking to you. Thank you very much for your time.
