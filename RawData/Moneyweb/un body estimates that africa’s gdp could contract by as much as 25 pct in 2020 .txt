 


NOMPU SIZIBA: The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, also known as UNECA, estimates that the African continent’s GDP could contract by as much as 2.5% this year. That’s a deeper cut than the IMF’s forecast of 1.6%. The African continent was one of the last regions to catch the Covid-19 bug, but steadily the number of cases has risen. As of May11, yesterday, the continent had recorded over 61 000 cases, and had over 2 200 deaths. National lockdowns in a number of countries have led to even greater hardship than before, while the economic fallout is set to be devastating.
Well, to take us through this issue and look at some of the problems that the continent is going to experience and some of the solutions to fixing the damage, I’m joined on the line by Neville Mandimika. He’s a sub-Saharan economist and fixed-income analyst at RMB.
Thank you so much for joining us, Neville. So – what’s your take on the Covid-19 impact on the African continent, and which countries or regions do you worry will be less resilient as economies get smacked by this situation, and particularly impacted by the national lockdowns?
NEVILLE MANDIMIKA: I think the situation is quite grave on the continent. Much like the rest of the world, Africa is going through its own iterations of trying to figure out how bad the situation is going to be. So far we see the impact emanating from three distinct channels: our financial markets, low demand for exports, and the supply-chain destruction.
As you rightly pointed out, the forecast in terms of what southern Africa is going to look like from a GDP growth perspective is quite worrying, and -2% is an average. There are countries that are going to be in double-digits in terms of their recessions. So it’s going to be quite a challenging for a lot of our countries.
As to which ones are feeling the pinch a lot more, I think the starting point has to be where we’ve seen a significant number of lockdowns in terms of days. So obviously the likes South Africa and Egypt stand out there in terms of the number of days that we’ve seen economic lockdowns. And these are gigantic countries when it comes to sub-Saharan Africa on average.
So where South Africa lands up, and where Egypt and Nigeria land up, is obviously going to be the primary composite of that negative -2.5% GDP contraction that you mentioned.
NOMPU SIZIBA: That’s right, these are the giants of the economy. But of course we’ve had smaller economies in East Africa and elsewhere really charging ahead and growing nicely – the likes of Rwanda and so on. Obviously, they’re also going to be impacted. But the point that I wanted to make is that I suppose economies that were previously on the back foot before Covid-19, like South Africa, in terms of their economic performance and their fiscal position are going to be hit that much harder.
NEVILLE MANDIMIKA: Yes. I think there are two perspectives on that. Firstly, how you got into this crisis really makes a huge difference. So you if you went into this crisis on low growth, shaky policies and a fractured political environment, then it makes decision-making and how you look after Covid-19 a very, very different story.
So I think you rightly mentioned there that the East African giants, such as Kenya and some of those nations, are doing relatively well in terms of the projected growth rates that they are going to be looking at. Of course, those numbers are extremely risky at this the stage, but I think they are going to look slightly better.
Some economies that do worry me, though. The likes of Nigeria and Angola worry me considerably because not only are they experiencing supply-chain destruction, but they are also getting hit from a low oil price. And, as you know, some of these economies are extremely reliant on oil proceeds in terms of their effective earnings within those particular countries. So not only are they experiencing those Covid-19 related issues, they are also experiencing this syncretic risk when it comes to oil prices.
And then of course the likes of Kenya are not only going through their own versions of the Covid-19 response scenario, but they are also going through issues such as flooding and locust invasions, which are affecting that part of the continent as well. So my broader point is how you got into the crisis matters. Also some of the idiosyncratic factors will determine how you look post Covid-19.
NOMPU SIZIBA: It is like a triple whammy effect, that story you are talking about with Kenya. But when all is said and done, at the end of the Covid-19 nightmare, when economies have been shattered and contractions have taken place on GDP and all the rest of it, how do African countries repair themselves, especially if they’re not in the proper fiscal position? We see globally, in the likes of America and Europe, loads and loads of money being chucked at the economy – probably more than is actually needed. But here we can’t afford to [do that], so how do we recover without the necessary resources?
NEVILLE MANDIMIKA: I think this is where multinational institutions, such as the IMF, the AfDB and some of those other organisations come in in handy, because they’ve got wads of cash that they can easily deploy to Africa. And we’ve seen the IMF do exceptionally well in this particular regard, where a lot of African countries have approached the fund for financing, and they’ve been very forthcoming in terms of providing that.
So I think that provides some sort of money cushion in order to not only mitigate balance-of-payment crises, but also address the very real and pertinent issues of public health expenditure for TPE procurement, for example. And this is where we need to get a little creative in terms of the sources of those particular fundings – also for markets such as Nigeria and possibly Morocco. In South Africa the domestic financial market then becomes a very, very important source of liquidity as well, because you can approach your pension funds, you can approach some of these savings pools in order to draw on some of those for funding purposes.
Of course, not every African market has got a very deep and developed domestic financial market. But for those that do, I think that’s a very important  source of liquidity and funding.
NOMPU SIZIBA: But the important thing is that those moneys should be invested in the right investments, with the right governance and so on, because we have heard in recent months when people were talking about government employee pension funds, there was a lot of resistance to that, even though it was being offered by Cosatu, because there are real concerns about where that kind of money is invested , because it is people’s pensions.
NEVILLE MANDIMIKA: I appreciate the fact that we have to be wise in terms of where exactly you draw the funding from. But I think it’s important to realise that first and most importantly is to ensure that there is funding, in order to ensure that lives are saved. So we have to band together. Of course, we’re not talking about wasteful expenditure, but we have to be considerate of the human need in this particular environment.
Unfortunately a lot of African countries may not have the Government Employees Pension Fund equivalent in their domestic markets. First and foremost all issues concerning fiscal restraint and all of that have to be addressed. But it’s important to ensure that we don’t lose lives en masse.
NOMPU SIZIBA: Do you think the African continent can do better when it works together as a bloc, rather than individual countries going to donors and investors piecemeal?
NEVILLE MANDIMIKA: One hundred percent. I think the issue of economies of scale is a very important  one. Say, for example, its fabric as a bloc wants to approach external ventilator manufacturers and order all of those things in one go, I think it would make logistics so much simpler and the cost of procuring some of these far, far simpler. So I think there is a real benefit in banding together in these particular times, because the virus doesn’t discriminate between countries or borders. It’s pervasive across the continent. So I think such an approach, where we band together, is going to be extremely vital in this particular environment .
NOMPU SIZIBA: Neville, I do appreciate your time. Thank you so much for joining us.
