Lenders, the National Treasury and central bank have created a credit-guarantee programme in which the government and banks will share profits made from the difference between the cost of funding and the rate of interest charged on loans, the Treasury said in an email on Friday. Should the gains not be enough to offset losses, these will be absorbed by banks — up to 6% of the loan, with the government shouldering the rest.
The initial phase of the project will target R100 billion of loans that will be offered at a single interest rate that still needs to be determined, and pegged to the central bank’s benchmark rate, the Treasury said. Banks will also be charged a guarantee fee.
South Africa is following the lead of other nations around the world seeking to provide stimulus to their economies through their banking systems. The loan guarantees form part of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s R500 billion support package aimed at rekindling growth and helping those worst affected by the lockdown.
Other key features of the programme:
A six-month repayment holiday will start from the first drawdown, from which interest will accumulate.
Repayment of interest and capital starts after six months and businesses have a maximum term of 60 months.
Each company may take out only one Covid-19 loan.
Loans will be available to businesses in good standing and with an annual turnover of less than 300 million rand.
Funds can be used for operational expenses such as salaries, rent and lease agreements, and contracts with suppliers.
Loans will cover up to three months of operational costs and will be drawn down monthly.
Banks are not obliged to extend Covid-19 loans, and those that do will use their normal risk evaluation and credit-application processes.
