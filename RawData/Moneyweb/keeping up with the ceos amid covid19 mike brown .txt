 

Many companies have had to change their business operations during the lockdown period. We caught up with several CEOs to find out how they’re holding up, and whether or not it’s ‘business as usual’. Here’s what Nedbank CEO Mike Brown said.
Where are you working from?
I’m working from home.
How are you conducting your meetings?
Using a combination of Skype, Zoom and Microsoft Teams.
How are you finding working away from your usual designated workstations?
While I miss the interpersonal contact, through email, Skype and other means I am able to be fully functional and productive.
Is the lockdown causing a huge disruption in your business operations?
Yes, as banking is an essential service we have invoked our full business continuity plans and through a combination of essential people still working from offices, branches and call centres as well as people working from home we are providing our clients with an uninterrupted banking service with strong encouragement for clients to use our digital channels wherever possible.
Clearly, as a bank, many of our clients are impacted by the national lockdown and we have been working very hard to put processes in place to support clients in good standing through this challenging time.
Has your company needed to transform to keep up with changing times, and if so, how?
I have been very impressed at how quickly we were able to transform large parts of our organisation to operate remotely, and I am sure this was assisted by the digital strategy we have been driving for several years and the associated investments we have made to facilitate this for our clients and for our staff.
I imagine the events of the last few weeks will only serve to accelerate this digital journey.
